# Odin Project Curriculum ⚡

> A repository containing all my challenges and projects from Odin Project Full Stack developer curriculum.

📆 **Start date**: *12th of February 2025*

The directory `/fnds` represents the **Foundations Course**, and contain all the code for that curriculum section.

## Foundations

Some notes and comments that pop-up while advancing the Foundations Course.

### Commit Messages

Among the assignments from Foundations there was the reading of [this article](https://cbea.ms/git-commit). I have found it important enough to register the "*Seven rules of a great Git commit message*" here:

1. Separate subject and body with a blank line;
2. Limit the subject line to **50 characters**;
3. Capitalize the subject line;
4. Do not end the subject line with any punctuation;
5. Use the **imperative mood** in the subject line;
6. Wrap the text body at **72 characters**;
7. Use the body to explain *what* and *why* vs. how;
